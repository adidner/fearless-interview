# Assumptions
- The API requires a namespace in addition to the key for the API requests. I chose an arbitrary namespace in this case because one was not specifified in the documentation given (normally I'd ask my lead or Product owner for such details but as this is a test I feel such measures are unecessary)
- Use case doesn't necesitate operations on the API like subtraction, multiplication, setting to an arbitrary number, querying for value without incrementing, or incrementing without getting the new value. As I do not know the use case for said project I cannot extrapolate whether or not such functionality will ever be necessary and thus implementing any of it now would be pre-emptive overengineering.
- Also it would be super weird to use something someone can publically add to for a lot of usecases so something to keep in mind I suppose
