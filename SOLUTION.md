# Assumptions
- The API requires a namespace in addition to the key for the API requests. I chose an arbitrary namespace in this case because one was not specifified in the documentation given (normally I'd ask my lead or Product owner for such details but as this is a test I feel such measures are unecessary)
- As I do not know the use case for said project I cannot extrapolate whether or not such functionality (multiplication, division, adding or subtracting in step) will ever be necessary and thus implementing any of it now would be pre-emptive overengineering and a waste of potential energy given the context.
- Also it would be strage to use something someone can publically add to for a lot of usecases so something to keep in mind I suppose
